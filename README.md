## Theoretical Background

Provide a brief overview of the QFT algorithm and its significance in quantum computing.

## Quantum Circuit Design

Explain how to build the quantum circuit for the QFT using Qiskit primitives such as gates and registers.

## Running the Circuit on IBM Quantum

Guide users on how to connect to an IBM Quantum backend and execute the QFT circuit. Mention the need to set up an IBM Quantum account and obtain an API token for running the circuit on real hardware.

## Results Analysis

Describe how to interpret the obtained results from the QFT circuit, including quantum state, probabilities, etc.

## Disclaimer

This template serves as a basic guide. Modify and enhance this README to accurately reflect your project's specific details and usage instructions as per your `Project_work.ipynb` file.

## Further Exploration

Suggest areas for further development and experimentation with the QFT, such as:
- Experimenting with different QFT variations (e.g., inverse QFT)
- Optimizing the QFT circuit for efficiency
- Applying the QFT in quantum algorithms (e.g., Shor's Algorithm)
- Integrating with other quantum computing libraries or frameworks

## Additional Notes

- Users may need to set up an IBM Quantum account and obtain an API token to run the circuit on real hardware.
- Refer to the [Qiskit documentation](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) for detailed API usage and code examples.
