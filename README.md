# Performance-Evaluation-of-Quantum-Fourier-Transform-on-IBM-Quantum-Device-and-Factoring-from-Period-finding-using-Shorâ€™s-Algorithm. 
This repository explores the implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on IBM Quantum hardware using a Jupyter Notebook titled `Project_work.ipynb`.

## Prerequisites

- **Qiskit:** A Python library for interacting with quantum computers. Install using `pip install qiskit`.
- **Familiarity with Quantum Computing:** Basic understanding of quantum circuits, gates, and algorithms is recommended.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IslamNiloy/QFT-on-IBM/
 ```
### Install Libraries:
```bash
pip install qiskit
 ```
